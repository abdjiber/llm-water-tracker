## Overview

LLM Water Tracker monitors your interactions with popular AI platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) and provides real-time insights into the equivalent water consumption of these interactions. Based on research showing that LLM interactions can consume significant amounts of water through data center cooling, this extension helps users make environmentally conscious decisions.
